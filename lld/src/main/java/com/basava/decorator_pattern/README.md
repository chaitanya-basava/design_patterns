# Decorator pattern

It is a Structural design pattern.

We have a base object which has some features say F1 and F2.
To add additional features say F3 to this class on top of the
existing oneâ€™s, we wrap it inside a decorator class, this 
new feature F3 is added in the decorator class.
This decorator class can be decorated by another class for adding even more features.
This decoration can go on to add newer features as time passes by.

Use-case:
In a pizza shop
1. Pizza would be the base obj
2. We can add topping on it (decorator)
3. We can add even extra topping on this (2nd decorator)
4. ......

Why is it needed: To avoid class explosion
i.e., making a new class for each new feature will just explode the number
of classes that we would have, leading to problems with code management.
Ex:
- Supreme
- SupremeChicken
- SupremeChickenPineapple
- SupremeChickenExtraCheese
- SupremeShrimp
- SupremeShrimpPineapple
- SupremeShrimpExtraCheese
- ......

The permutations of the # classes will keep increasing for every
new feature being added. Leading to many classes having to be implemented.
Consider the below instance

2 - base classes, 3 - non veg types, 3 - toppings
- without decorator pattern: 2 * 3 * 3 = 18 classes
- with decorator pattern: 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 classes
