# Design Patterns

In this we discuss and implement examples for various design patterns in LLD.

Broadly design patterns can be categorised into 3 types:
1. Creational design patterns
2. Behavioural design patterns
3. Structural design patterns

Each of the categories have multiple different patterns, the important one's
from the bunch would be covered in this repo.

### Creational design patterns
provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code

- [X] [Abstract Factory Method Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/abstract_factory_pattern)
- [X] [Singleton Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/singleton_pattern)
- [ ] Prototype Pattern
- [X] [Builder Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/builder_pattern)
- [X] [Object Pool Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/object_pool_pattern)

### Behavioural design patterns
take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects

- [X] [Strategy Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/strategy_pattern)
- [X] [Observer Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/observer_pattern)
- [X] [Chain of Responsibility Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/chain_of_responsibility)
- [ ] Command Pattern
- [ ] Interpreter Pattern
- [ ] Iterator Pattern
- [ ] Mediator Pattern
- [ ] Memento Pattern
- [ ] State Pattern
- [ ] Template Pattern

### Structural design patterns
explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient

- [X] [Decorator Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/decorator_pattern)
- [X] [Adapter Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/adapter_pattern)
- [ ] Bridge Pattern
- [X] [Composite Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/composite_pattern)
- [ ] Facade Pattern
- [X] [Flyweight Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/flyweight_pattern)
- [X] [proxy Pattern](src/main/java/com/basava/proxy_pattern)
